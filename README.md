# PowerInspect API Examples
Welcome to the Autodesk PowerInspect API Examples repository.   This repository provides the source code for the advanced add-ins which may be added to the PowerInspect application. These are normally only supplied in compiled DLL form, allowing the user to optionally load these DLL add-ins into the PowerInspect application.

The PowerInspect development team is not actively maintaining or enhancing these add-ins.  The source code is being made available to third parties who would like to do their own enhancements, or who would like to use these examples as templates for creating their own add-ins.  Contributions to this repo will be reviewed and considered for inclusion (see below), but please be aware that these add-ins have low development priority.

To learn more about PowerInspect, visit the forum [here](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/powerinspect/ct-p/277) or the product website [here](https://www.autodesk.com/products/PowerInspect/overview).

## Building the add-ins

There are just a few simple steps for building one of these add-ins:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the README.md file for the specific add-in.
3. Follow the build instructions in the README.md file.

### Running the Add-In

After building your add-in, you will be able to access it from within PowerInspect by following these steps.

- Run PowerInspect
- Press the "File" button on the top left of the ribbon.
- Open the Add-In Manager form by choosing "Options" and selecting "Add-In Manager".
- Select your add-in in the list and click OK. (You may need to "Browse" for the add-in if it does not appear in the list).
- Your add-in should now appear under the "Addin Tab" in the ribbon for PowerInspect.
