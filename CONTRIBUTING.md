# Contributing to PowerInspect API Examples

The PowerInspect team will consider contributions to these example add-ins in accordance with the guidelines below.

## Contributing code

To contribute fixes or enhancements to these add-in examples, please:

1. Submit a pull request which clearly describes the purpose of the code change.
    - What is the issue and how it is fixed?
    - What is the new feature and how is it used?
2. Follow the coding style that is already used in the source code.
3. Describe how you have tested the changes.
4. Include a screenshot showing changes to the UI, if any.
5. The PowerInspect team will review requests in the order they are received.
4. If a reviewed PR requires changes by the owner, the owner of the PR has 30 days to respond. If the PR has seen no activity by that date, it will be either closed by the team or perhaps taken over by someone on the team.

## Contribution "Bar"

The PowerInspect team will merge changes that fix bugs or enhance the ability of other users to use these add-ins as templates for extending these interfaces or creating new ones.

The PowerInspect team will not merge changes that have narrowly-defined benefits.

Note that the add-ins that are currently distributed with the PowerInspect product may be built from a separate copy of this source. As such, contributions merged into this repository may be built into the add-ins distributed with PowerInspect.
